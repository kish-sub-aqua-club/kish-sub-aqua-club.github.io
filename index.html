          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>Kish Sub Aqua Club was founded in 1986 by a core group of friends and colleagues who were interested in sports diving. The club is named after the lighthouse that stands on the Kish banks, a few miles north east of Dalkey Island.  We currently have circa 40 active members ranging from their early twenties to mid fifties, with a good balance of male and female divers, as well as a range of qualifications from novice to very experienced.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We swim in the Guinness pool on Watling Street (opposite St. James' Gate) at 8 p.m. each Wednesday. We sometimes play Underwater Rugby in the last half hour, and its great fun! During the diving season, we dive most Sunday mornings out of Dun Laoighaire. We have licenses for the wrecks of the Vanguard and the Tayleur, but we also dive off various locations from Ireland's Eye and Lambay, depending on the weather.</p>

          <h3>What We Offer</h3>
          <div class="col-md-9">
            <p>We offer weekly diving in and around Dublin bay from March to October every Sunday and most Thursday nights in Dublin Bay. Diving in Dublin ranges from the Muglins to Lambay Is. and includes many well known wrecks such as the MV Leinster, Guide Me II, RMS Tayleur and the Vanguard. We teach people how to dive from scratch. We also welcome divers from other diving organisations such as PADI & BASC we provide cross-over training to such candidates. Our members range in age from 17 to 60, and we have a vast experience built up within the club.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We organise weekend dive trips away as well as week-long trips to varied locations around the Irish Coast (both north and south of the border). We have dived as a club on foreign dive holidays including Scotland (wreck diving), Gozo, Malta, Corsica, Cyprus and the Red Sea. Many of our golden oldie members have dived such places as Mauritius, Australia, St. Lucia and South Africa.</p>

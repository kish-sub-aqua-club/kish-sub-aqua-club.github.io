After a long absence, we're looking forward to welcoming new and old club members to our Christmas Party in January, 2022 at The Barge, 42 Charlemont St., Dublin 2. We hope to get good support for this and will be running a raffle, plenty of spot prizes and have a bit of craic to lift the winter gloom!

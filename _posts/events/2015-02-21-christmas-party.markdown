Our usual Christmas Party will be going ahead on Saturday 21st of February 2015, at Foley's Bar, Merrion Row, Dublin 2. We hope to get good support for this and will be running a raffle, with cash prizes, plenty of spot prizes and a bit of craic to lift the winter gloom. Please put the date in your diary and come along!

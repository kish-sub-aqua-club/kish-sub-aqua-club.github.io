<p class="intro">
  Over it's long and growing history, Kish Sub Aqua Club has visited hundreds if not thousands of different dive sites around Ireland and beyond in the World. There's always a few good stories that stand out, the remarkable tales that only seem to get better with each passing year (and pint ;-). Here's just a small selection of some of the adventures our members have taken the time to document.
